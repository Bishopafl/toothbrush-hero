## ðŸ§° Developer Shortcuts

To make development faster, the `Makefile` includes commands for generating Laravel classes without having to type long `docker exec` commands.

## Artisan Make commands

### Create a Model (with migration)
```bash
make model NAME=BrushingSession
```
This will run:
```bash
php artisan make:model BrushingSessionModel -m
```

### Create a Controller
```bash
make controller NAME=BrushingSessionController
```
This will run:
```bash
php artisan make:controller BrushingSessionController
```

### Create a Form Request
```bash
make request NAME=StoreBrushingSessionRequest
```
This will run:
```bash
php artisan make:request StoreBrushingSessionRequest
```

### SSH into the Container
```bash
make ssh
```
This drops you into a shell inside the running container so you can run artisan, composer, npm, etc.


## With this setup:
- You donâ€™t have to remember the container name every time  
- All artisan commands can be called via `make` shortcuts  
- You can generate models, controllers, and requests directly from your host terminal
